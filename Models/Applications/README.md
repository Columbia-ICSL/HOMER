# Android Applications Leveraging HOMER

This repository contains the source code for the dual camera and montage applications for Android. Currently, both applications are only tested on the HTC One M8 with the primary dependency for the dual camera application being the ability to programmatically record from both the front and back camera simultaneously. 

## Installation/Build

The **DualCamera** and **Montage** folders correspond to sources for the two apps respectively. To install each app onto an Android device, you can open up each folder as a project in Android Studio and run them. More specifically:
1. Open Android Studio and launch the Android SDK manager. 
2. Ensure that the following are installed and updated to the latest version:
    * *Android SDK Platform-Tools*
    * *Android Support Repository*
    * *Google Repository*
3. Return to Android Studio and select *Open an existing Android Studio project*.
4. Select the **DualCamera** or **Montage** directory (depending on which you are installing).
5. Run the app on the desired connected device.
